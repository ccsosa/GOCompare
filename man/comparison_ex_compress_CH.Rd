\description{
This dataset is the results of running the compareGOspecies species and
 it is composed of three slots:
\describe{
  \item{distance}{numeric: Jaccard distance matrix }
  \item{shared_GO_list}{data.frame with shared GO terms between species}
  \item{unique_GO_list}{data.frame with unique GO terms and their belonging two each species}
}
